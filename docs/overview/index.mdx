# Overview

Otterize is a declarative and zero-trust approach to access management that empowers you to streamline workload IAM while ensuring maximum security.

## How does Otterize work?

Otterize integrates into your Kubernetes clusters using a Helm chart that deploys some core [open-source components](https://github.com/otterize/), including the network mapper, intents-operator, and credential-operator. These components work in tandem to identify and secure access. Learn more about these components below.

### Network mapper

The network mapper is a zero-config open-source tool that provides insights into your network traffic without modifying your code or adding additional layers. Once Otterize is installed, the network monitor will automatically inspect pod traffic, including tariff from pod-to-pod, pod-to-public internet egress, Istio Envoy sidecar, pod-to-Kafka topics, and more to follow. This data is then collected in an in-memory database for various uses, including exporting and viewing.

For more information, visit the [network mapper repository](https://github.com/otterize/network-mapper#about)

### Credential operator

Once Otterize is installed into a cluster, it [resolves a service name](https://github.com/otterize/credentials-operator#service-name-resolution-and-automatic-pod-labeling) for each pod and registers it with either Otterize Cloud or a SPIRE server. Once registered, pods can use the credential operator to generate various secrets/credentials for mTLS or credential-based access to services like PostgreSQL, Kafka, or other connections.

For more information, visit the [credential operator repository](https://github.com/otterize/credentials-operator#about)

### Intents operator

The Otterize intents operator is a tool to network and service access policy creation straightforward. The intents operator uses a declarative policy syntax called Intent-Based Access Control (IBAC) to connect services. IBAC policies allow you to specify a caller and the type of access they should be provided. The intents operator then generates and applies the appropriate service-specific policy (IAM, ACL, NetworkPolicy, etc) to enable that defined access.
