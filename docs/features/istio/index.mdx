# Istio

Otterize can map and secure access with Istio HTTP connections across your Kubernetes services.

### About

When enabling Istio support, Otterize's network mapping tool can determine which Kubernetes services are connected and which HTTP methods are being used. This graph of connections can then be leveraged to automate IBAC based access policies that result in Istio AuthorizationPolicy(s).

### How does it work

1. First, the cluster must have [Otterize installed](/overview/installation). With Istio support enabled by setting the following flag:

```bash
--set networkMapper.istiowatcher.enable=true
```

2. To monitor connections and HTTP methods, we need to enable connection telemetry data within Istio. This can be enabled with the following YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: telemetry.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: Telemetry
metadata:
  name: mesh-default
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  # Configure access logging for Istio services
  accessLogging:
    # Define the access logging provider, in this case, Envoy
    - providers:
        - name: envoy
  metrics:
    # Configure metrics collection for Istio services using Prometheus
    - providers:
        - name: prometheus
      # Customize metric tag overrides
      overrides:
        - tagOverrides:
            # Map the "request_method" metric tag to "request.method" value
            request_method:
              value: request.method
            # Map the "request_path" metric tag to "request.path" value
            request_path:
              value: request.path

```

Once installed, Otterize will query Envoy sidecars for known connections and building an in-memory map of the relationships. After the map is built your can then view those relationships.

**To Manage Access**

You simply need to define and apply your intent based access control ([IBAC](/overview/intent-based-access-control)) policies for your services.

```yaml

apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v1alpha3
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: client
  namespace: otterize-tutorial-istio
spec:
  service:
    name: client
  calls:
    - name: server-abc
      type: http
      HTTPResources:
        - path: /client-path
          methods: [ GET ]

```
