# AWS IAM

Otterize can provide least-privilege access from your EKS Kubernetes clusters to AWS Resources with [IBAC](/overview/intent-based-access-control/) support for AWS's IAM policies.

### About

In many workloads, EKS clusters must access external cloud resources such as databases, object storage, or additional services. Otterize provides unique credentials and policies for each pod for exactly the authorization they require.

### How does it work

To follow along with a full example, take a look at [Automate AWS IAM for EKS](/access-types/aws-iam/Examples/aws-iam-eks)

1. First, the EKS cluster must have [Otterize installed](/overview/installation).
2. We must label the pod with `credentials-operator.otterize.com/create-aws-role: "true"`
3. Once that is complete, Otterize’s credential operator will create a role and an `AssumeRolePolicy` bound to ServiceAccount.
4. At this point, the role does not have the ability to perform any actions. We will need to create a ClientIntents YAML for the access the service requires and apply it to our cluster. Below is an example of a ClientIntents file for accessing an S3 bucket. View the [reference](/access-types/aws-iam/Reference) to learn more about the AWS IAM Client Intent syntax.
5. Once the intent is applied, a new policy will be attached to the service’s role with the appropriate access.

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v1alpha3
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: server
spec:
  service:
    name: server
  calls:
    - name: arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket-*/*
      type: aws
      awsActions:
        - "s3:PutObject"
        - "s3:GetObject"
```

### Coming Soon

Building least-privilege access can be difficult. Many actions have dependent actions, or services can require a lot of access to perform their functions. To help reduce this burden, Otterize will provide automated ClientIntents based on the actions your service actually requires by detecting the calls being made and converting them into the necessary YAML syntax.
